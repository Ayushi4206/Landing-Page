REFLECTION & APPROACH

Approach:

When building the web page the approach I took involved each step focusing on the description and requirements of the product.
Created the main sections
(navigation,header,features,pricing,call to action footer) in the order specified.
Used comments to organize document the code.
Added placeholder links and simple content to each section for testing.
 

Learning:

Practiced using semantic HTML tags like <header>, <section>, <footer>
Learned how to create navigation menus with <ul> and <li>
Used horizontal lines <hr> to separate content visually.
